# 🕰 Pomodoro
A Pomodoro Clock I built (and also use) as final project to complete the freeCodeCamp.org 'Frontend Libraries' [certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielvanc/front-end-libraries).

Very barebones looking at the moment, but will be improved as and when I get the time to work on it. 

See list of issues on those that will be worked on first.

Clone, Fork, use and enjoy 👍🏼
