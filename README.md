# 🕰 Pomodoro

A small timer I built (and use) as final project to complete
the freeCodeCamp.org 'Frontend Libraries'
[certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielvanc/front-end-libraries).

I'm currently working on the issue's listed so watch this
space!

In the mean time, Clone, Fork, and make your own version! 👍🏼
